# Project Overview
***
The pandemic has changed the way the world operates daily. Many things are done virtually now. 
A lot of people interested in fitness are confused on how to start since they do not want to go to the gym based on personal health issues, government restrictions, gym restrictions, etc.
I want to create an app that will help this group of people to be able to work out from wherever they are through the help of a trainer of their choosing.
